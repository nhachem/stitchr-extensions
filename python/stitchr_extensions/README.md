# (Data)Stitchr Extensions

## What are (Data)Stitchr Extensions? ###

This code base contains additional tooling to support [Stitchr](https://github.com/nhachem/).

Most of this tooling is to consolidate adding transformation functions to support
data validation
dataframe transforms
data wrangling
udf functions

 This is the python version of the code under development.

to run tests make sure you set up the ``ROOT_DIR`... from the top project directory `source bash/stitchr_extensions_env.sh`
Then `cd python/stitchr-extensions` and run

`python -m unittest tests/test_df_transforms.py`
